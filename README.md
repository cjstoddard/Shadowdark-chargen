Notes:

In light of the information provided by The Arcane Library and their Lawyer in a streaming event, I have removed all the Cursed Scroll classes and backgrounds, I have also rewritten the ancestry and class features so as not to be verbatum from the rule book.

I have added the Ranger and Bard classes, please keep in mind the Bard class is still under development and may change.

This is a commandline, text program, there is no fancy Windows GUI. The program will ask if you want to save the character, if you say yes, it will save it as a text file.

I am aware this is really bad code. I originally wrote this program back in the early 90's to roll up D&D characters. While I am capable of cleaning it up and making it into a decent program, I choose not to, I like the old school coding because it goes along with the old school feel of the Shadowdark RPG.

There is a Linux (.lnx) and a Windows (.exe) binary in the bin folder for those of you who do not want to go to the trouble of downloading and installing QB64 or FreeBasic. I use Linux as my primary operating system, so the Windows binary may occassionally fall a few days behind the Linux binary. Sorry OS X users, I do not own a Mac, you are on your own.

Thank you to Kelsey Dionne for creating the Shadowdark RPG, your hard work and creativity is appreciated.
